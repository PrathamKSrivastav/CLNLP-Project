# Text Classification with NLP

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a basic **Text Classification** pipeline using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

## Project Structure

```
CL_NPL.ipynb       # Main Jupyter Notebook for text classification
requirements.txt   # Python dependencies (create if needed)
README.md          # This file
```

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the process of:
- Loading and preprocessing textual data
- Converting text to numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Training a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-classification-nlp.git
cd text-classification-nlp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install directly:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn notebook
```

### 3. Launch the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook CL_NPL.ipynb
```

## Example Output

After training, you'll see outputs like:

- Accuracy: `85.7%`
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Scikit-learn 
- Pandas & NumPy 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Try advanced models like SVM, XGBoost, or Transformers
- Deploy as a Flask API
